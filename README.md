# Driver dataset - 2 400+ Image
Dataset comprises **2,400+** images of **304** people capturing diverse driving behaviors, monitored by RGB and infrared cameras. It is designed for research in **behavior monitoring**, improving **driver safety**, and reducing risky driving incidents and reducing risky driving incidents, **analyzing aggressive driving**, distracted driving, and other unsafe behaviors to develop **solutions for safer driving practices**.  - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/driver-behaviour-dataset/?utm_source=github-sc&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Driving-Behavior-Dataset)**
